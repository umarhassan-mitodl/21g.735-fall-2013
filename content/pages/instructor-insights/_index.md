## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course *21G.735 Advanced Topics in Hispanic Literature and Film: The Films of Luis Buñuel* as it was taught by Prof. Elizabeth Garrels from 1999-2013.

This course explored films spanning the entire career of pioneering Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel (1900-1983). The class materials paid special attention to his Mexican period, in exile, and the films he made in, and about, Spain. The course focused on historical contexts and relevant film criticism.

This course was taught at MIT seven times between 1999 and 2013. Instead of representing a single semester of a course, as is typical on OpenCourseWare, 21G.735 represents a history of the course, and a compilation of all the materials used to teach it, during this period of time.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Improve ability to read, write, listen, and speak in Spanish

- Demonstrate intellectual maturation and a growing awareness of and sensitivity to the formal aspects of narrative structure and filmic language
- Increase one’s knowledge of the social and historical realities reflected in the films and learn to discern each film’s point of view regarding these realities

- Heritage learners (U.S. Latinos with some home Spanish, but not necessarily formal training), as well as non-native students, were generally required to have an interview in Spanish with the instructor in order to be considered for enrollment.
- Students were required to have advanced knowledge of both Spanish and English, as reading materials were often quite sophisticated, both in content and style.
