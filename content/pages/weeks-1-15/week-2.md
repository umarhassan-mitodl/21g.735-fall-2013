## Session 2

### Topic

Continue discussing {{% resource_link "f618207f-ff71-487a-a72b-836173662984" "*Un chien andalou*" %}} (Un perro andaluz). Directed by Luis Buñuel. Black and White, 16 min. 1929.

### Readings

Guión. "*Un perro andaluz.*" In *Escritos de Luis Buñuel*. Edited by Luis Buñuel and Manuel Lopez Villegas. Editorial Paginas de Espuma, 2000. ISBN: 9788493124304.

Freud, Sigmund. "E. Representation By Symbols in Dreams – Some Further Typical Dreams." In *The Interpretation of Dreams: The Complete and Definitive Text*. Basic Books, 2010. ISBN: 9780465019779.

\[Discreet Art\] "*Un chien andalou*." Chapter 1.

Note: Freud's book was originally published, in German, in 1900, but the material in this particular section started to appear only in the 2{{< sup "nd" >}} and 3{{< sup "rd" >}} editions of 1909 and 1911. The text of the Avon edition (1965) reproduces a later edition and incorporates changes added in editions subsequent to the third. In 1923, the first Spanish translation of the book was published in Madrid as *La interpretación de los sueños*; the translator was Luis López Ballesteros.

Students should start familiarizing themselves with the section "{{% resource_link "f4990e0e-87a0-44ca-be0e-c3ceea5bef68" "Obsesiones" %}}" of the Centro Virtual Cervantes website. Buñuel includes recurring images (of gestures, objects, animals, human body parts, etc.) in his films throughout his long career. Students should also access the section "{{% resource_link "3dc7dd24-4d74-4591-805d-0522a3bd20f9" "Filmografía y bibliografía" %}}." Read the contents of the first page and beginning of the second, which include the filmographies of Buñuel's first two films, "Un chien andalou" (Un perro andaluz," 1929) and "L'Age d'or" ("La edad de oro," 1930).

Please note that the list of actors for *Un perro andaluz* is incomplete. The man on the beach at the end of the film is played by Robert Hommet. I recommend you download and retain the pages of the Filmography.

If students wish to view early paintings by Salvador Dalí, that is, up until the mid-1930's, when his friendship with Buñuel ended, the most complete website organized chronologically is on {{% resource_link "47f0d343-30d6-45bc-8fa3-ba9d7dd3b218" "ABCgallery.com" %}}.
